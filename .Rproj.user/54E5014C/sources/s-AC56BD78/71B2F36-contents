I am a Data Scientist at [Sema4](https://sema4.com), where I work to analyze Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data to help gain insight on oncology drugs and guide cancer treatment.

I am currently pursuing a second Master degree in Information Technology and Web Science at [Rensselear Politechnic Institute (RPI)](https://www.rpi.edu) as a part-time student.

I love R, data visualization and data story-telling. My personal goal of 2019 is to improve my presentation and communication skills to better present the data analysis results in a clear and easy-to-understand way.
